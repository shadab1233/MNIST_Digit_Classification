# neural_netwrok
This is a neural network from scratch. It uses mathematical formula to adjust parameters during training. After training it classify 28 X 28 pixel image into one of the digits with an accuracy of 85%.

# How prediction is made:

![alt_text](https://github.com/Shadab-ju/neural_netwrok/blob/main/digit_img.png)  

Above image has 784 pixel that is stored in __array[28][28]__.
This image data is fed to the model after traing and model predicts a digit based on array value.


### P.S: I can add working principle of this model in readme file if someone open an issue or I can merge pull request if someone create a pull request after adding the detailed explaination.
